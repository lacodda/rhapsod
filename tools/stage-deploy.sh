# The deploy tool uploads a `dist` directory as it finds it, so `dist` has to
# contain exactly what the remote build needs - not the repository root, which
# also holds `target/` (gigabytes of host-architecture artifacts), a local
# `content/` and `data/`, and on a machine that has run the stand, a `.env`.
#
# `git archive` is the filter: it emits tracked files and nothing else, so a
# secret that was never committed cannot be uploaded by accident.
