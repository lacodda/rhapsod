/**
 * The product's mark: a hex tile with the line's monogram in it.
 *
 * Inline rather than an `<img>` pointing at the favicon: the header is the
 * first thing painted, and a mark that arrives on its own request is a mark
 * that flickers in after the page. The shape is the same one in
 * `assets/logo-s.svg` and in the line's brand registry.
 *
 * The colour is not written here. `text-accent` is rhapsod's product colour in
 * the line's vocabulary, and `currentColor` follows it - so the tile stays
 * right if the accent ever moves, and the theme keeps its say. A hex value in
 * this file would be the one place that did not.
