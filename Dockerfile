# The stand is a Raspberry Pi, so this image is built for aarch64. Building it
# on the Pi itself keeps the architecture honest: no cross-compilation, and no
# chance of shipping an x86 binary that only fails on the stand. The publish
# workflow builds the same file on native arm64 and amd64 runners.
